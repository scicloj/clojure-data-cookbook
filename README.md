# Clojure Data Cookbook

Recipes for doing common data science tasks in Clojure.

## Status: Alpha

Please bear with me as I work on through this project :D

The [outline](https://github.com/scicloj/clojure-data-cookbook/blob/main/outline-draft.md) is available to get a sense of what will be included.

## Goals

1. Provide a book of recipes of common data science tasks in Clojure.
2. Document scicloj community stack recommendations.

## Rationale

["Clojure for Data Science in the Real World" by Kira McLean](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MguatDl5u2Q)

## Contributing

The most valuable contributions to this effort at the moment would be working on the libraries used for data science in Clojure. There are still many rough edges, and polishing them is what will make Clojure's data science ecoystem feel ready for professional use.

Pull requests welcome!
