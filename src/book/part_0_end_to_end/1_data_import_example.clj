;; TODO: Summary

;; To build a model that predict house prices, we need data about recent sales of similar houses. Luckily the organization that tracks all of this data in my province has released it for public use under a [very permissive open data license](https://www.pvsc.ca/sites/default/files/shared/Open%20Data%20and%20Information%20Government%20Licence%20-%20PVSC%20and%20Participating%20Municipalities.pdf), so we'll use that data to find what we're looking for.

;; First we need the data about actual house sales. That's available in this [Parcel Sales History](https://www.thedatazone.ca/Assessment/Parcel-Sales-History/6a95-ppg4/about_data) dataset.
