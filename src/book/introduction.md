# Introduction

Most people have some sort of data they want to extract insights from. In the context of this book, by "data science" I just mean working with data broadly speaking. In this sense, anyone with data to investigate who can extract some meaning from it is a data scientist. The goal is to provide a reference for anyone who has data to work with and an interest in doing it in Clojure, documenting the current community recommendations and default stack for data science in Clojure.
