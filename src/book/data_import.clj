;; # Data import {}


;; ## From a file

;; Tablecloth supports loading data directly into a dataset from most types of files. Many work out of the box, and some require extra dependencies. The full list of available options is [well-documented in the tablecloth docs](https://scicloj.github.io/tablecloth/index.html#dataset-api). Below are examples of how to work with many types of files.

;; ### CSV


;;





;; ## From a URL

;; ## From a hand-written data entry

;; ## From a database

;; ## From a web page


;; ## Other considerations

;; ### File encoding
;; ### Column header formatting
;; ### Column data types
